# Team Portfolio

## Description 

This project uses inputs from the command line to create a team portfolio that includes one manager, any number of engineers, and any number of interns. The command line will prompt you to add manager info, then ask if you will like to add an intern, an engineer, or end your project. The program will then create an html file with the team info entered. The dist folder of this project contains an example of an file that was made with this application. This will be replaced once you run it and provide your own information.
